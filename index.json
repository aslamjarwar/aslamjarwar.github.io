Another challenge concerning IoT sensors or devices is the incursion of noise when used in an industrial environment. The noisy samples affect the decision support system that could lead to financial and operational losses. This paper proposes a Noisy Encoder using Artificial Intelligence of Things (NEAT) architecture for fault diagnosis in IoT edge devices. NEAT combines autoencoders and Inception module to co-train the clean and noisy samples for solving the said problem. Experimental results on benchmark datasets reveal that the NEAT architecture is noise resilient in comparison to the existing works. Furthermore, we also show that the NEAT architecture has lightweight characteristics as it yields a lower number of parameters, weight storage, training, and testing times that support its real-life applicability in an Industrial IoT environment.","tags":[],"title":"NEAT: A Resilient Deep Representational Learning for Fault Detection using Acoustic Signals in IIoT Environment","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Dr. Muhammad Aslam Jarwar","吳恩達"],"categories":["Demo","教程"],"content":"Overview  The Wowchemy website builder for Hugo, along with its starter templates, is designed for professional creators, educators, and teams/organizations - although it can be used to create any kind of site The template can be modified and customised to suit your needs.

Data provenance is a record of creation and modification of data. It has many uses, including scientific reproducibility, debugging, and establishing trust in data. The insight driving this project is that the core elements of the data environment (agents with access to the data; supplementary data which might be integrated with the data; infrastructure in which the data is stored and processed; and governance of the data) have the potential to be mapped with W3C PROV [3]. W3C PROV is an interoperability standard for provenance that defines the actors, entities, and activities which together created the dataset, and the relationships between them. Using PROV, we can map where data came from, and how they were processed. The objectives of this project are to:\r\rUndertake an analysis of modelling data environments, expressing terms as described in [1] using PROV concepts, including any domain-specific extensions to PROV that may be required to support this new usage.\rIdentify how to use provenance not only as a record of the development of the data, but also to help create contractual agreement in how data will be utilised after sharing, and how it can be used to support/comply with GDPR and other data privacy legislation.\rDetermine what improvements can be made to the operational power of the ADF by using the PROV representation.\r\rCollaborations:\rPlease refer project main website \r\rTask and Responsibilities:\r\rReasoning over provenance for analysing data situation in the data environments.\rTo Investigate models and approaches to automating and testing of compliance of data ethics, GDPR, etc.\rTo investigate Retrospective, Prospective, Prescriptive, Proscriptive provenance for expressing data situation and reasoning for anonymisation decisions.\r\r\r","date":1598918400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1598918400,"objectID":"bfa788788a278b789d8bdd8f1452d8fd","permalink":"https://example.com/project/provanon/","publishdate":"2020-09-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/provanon/","section":"project","summary":"In this project we are investigating that how the use of  provenance formalisms will enable us to capture the necessary features of the complex dynamic data situations to allow more principled analysis of risk, the requirements of anonymisation and related topics such as Cyber Security, privacy and data utility.","tags":["PROVANON"],"title":"Provenance and Anonymisation (PROVANON)","type":"project"},{"authors":[],"categories":[],"content":"Create slides in Markdown with Wowchemy Wowchemy | Documentation\n Features  Efficiently write slides in Markdown 3-in-1: Create, Present, and Publish your slides Supports speaker notes Mobile friendly slides   Controls  Next: Right Arrow or Space Previous: Left Arrow Start: Home Finish: End Overview: Esc Speaker notes: S Fullscreen: F Zoom: Alt + Click PDF Export: E   Code Highlighting Inline code: variable\nCode block:\nporridge = \u0026quot;blueberry\u0026quot;\rif porridge == \u0026quot;blueberry\u0026quot;:\rprint(\u0026quot;Eating...\u0026quot;)\r  Math In-line math: $x + y = z$\nBlock math:\n$$ f\\left( x \\right) = ;\\frac{{2\\left( {x + 4} \\right)\\left( {x - 4} \\right)}}{{\\left( {x + 4} \\right)\\left( {x + 1} \\right)}} $$\n Fragments Make content appear incrementally\n{{% fragment %}} One {{% /fragment %}}\r{{% fragment %}} **Two** {{% /fragment %}}\r{{% fragment %}} Three {{% /fragment %}}\r Press Space to play!\nOne  Two  Three \n A fragment can accept two optional parameters:\n class: use a custom style (requires definition in custom CSS) weight: sets the order in which a fragment appears   Speaker Notes Add speaker notes to your presentation\n{{% speaker_note %}}\r- Only the speaker can read these notes\r- Press `S` key to view\r{{% /speaker_note %}}\r Press the S key to view the speaker notes!\n Only the speaker can read these notes Press S key to view    Themes  black: Black background, white text, blue links (default) white: White background, black text, blue links league: Gray background, white text, blue links beige: Beige background, dark text, brown links sky: Blue background, thin dark text, blue links    night: Black background, thick white text, orange links serif: Cappuccino background, gray text, brown links simple: White background, black text, blue links solarized: Cream-colored background, dark green text, blue links   Custom Slide Customize the slide style and background\n{{\u0026lt; slide background-image=\u0026quot;/media/boards.jpg\u0026quot; \u0026gt;}}\r{{\u0026lt; slide background-color=\u0026quot;#0000FF\u0026quot; \u0026gt;}}\r{{\u0026lt; slide class=\u0026quot;my-style\u0026quot; \u0026gt;}}\r  Custom CSS Example Let\u0026rsquo;s make headers navy colored.\nCreate assets/css/reveal_custom.css with:\n.reveal section h1,\r.reveal section h2,\r.reveal section h3 {\rcolor: navy;\r}\r  Questions?

Due to its easiness and effective medium, people share and exchange information, carry out discussions on various events, and express their opinions. For effective policy making and understanding the response of a community on different events, we need to monitor and analyze social media. In social media, some users are more influential, for example, a famous politician may have more influence than a common person. These influential users belong to specific communities. The main objective of this project was to analyze the sentiments of a specific community on various events. For detecting the event-based sentiments of a community we developed a novel framework.\r\rTasks:\r\rTo detect communities from twitter data sets using snowball sampling.\rTo identify events based on demographic locations and topics using recurrent neural network.\rTo detect event wise sentiments of communities using deep using recurrent neural network.\r\r\r","date":1420070400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1420070400,"objectID":"33872b84a553d84216dc022a5a93406c","permalink":"https://example.com/project/communiments/","publishdate":"2015-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/communiments/","section":"project","summary":"The main objective of this project was to detect the sentiments of a specific community on various events.","tags":["communiments"],"title":"Detecting Event related Sentiments of a Community (CommuniMents)","type":"project"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"f26b5133c34eec1aa0a09390a36c2ade","permalink":"https://example.com/admin/config.yml","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/admin/config.yml","section":"","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"","type":"wowchemycms"}]
