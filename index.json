In order to ensure compatibility with BFO, we draw on a number of existing ontologies. These include BFO, 3 the Common Core Ontologies (CCO), 4 and the Common Core Cyber Ontology (C3O). 5 Initial sections of the report document the various classes and relationships asserted in these ontologies. BFO is documented in Section 2; Sections 3– 10 document the CCO; and Section 11 documents the C3O. It should be noted that these ontologies are not documented in full. For reasons of brevity, we have limited the scope of the documentation to ontology elements that are of particular relevance to the SOfIoTS project. The aim of the SOfIoTS project is to advance our understanding of the current state-ofthe-art in respect of security provision in Internet of Things (IoT) ontologies. It also aims to extend the current state-of-the-art by specifying an ontological framework that can be integrated into the UK Digital Twin model.

It also aims to extend the current state-of-the-art by specifying an expansible IoT ontological framework that can be integrated with the UK Digital Twin model. The present report summarizes the progress made in respect of these objectives. In particular, we describe how a common upper-level ontology, called Basic Formal Ontology (BFO), can be used to model security concepts, IoT devices, digital twins, IoT data flows, and human factors. While BFO is not the only upper-level ontology that could be used for IoT security modelling, there are a number of reasons that make it a compelling choice for the SOfIoTS project. Aside from the fact that BFO is one of the most widely used upper-level ontologies, it also serves as the basis for the Industrial Ontologies Foundry (IOF). BFO also serves as the basis for a prominent cyber ontology initiative that subsumes work by The MITRE Corporation. Finally, there have been a number of attempts to apply BFO to Building Information Modeling (BIM), and BFO was one of the upper-level ontologies surveyed as the part of the effort to develop an Information Management Framework (IMF) for the UK National Digital Twin (NDT) initiative. Prior work has identified a number of recurring concepts across security ontologies. These include the concepts of threat, risk, vulnerability, asset, security mechanism, and so on. In the present report, we discuss how each of these concepts can be accommodated within a BFO-conformant ontology. As far as we are aware, this is the first attempt to provide an ontological characterization of securityrelated concepts from a BFO perspective. In addition to security concepts, we also discuss how IoT devices, digital twins, and IoT information flows can be represented in BFO. Again, as far as we are aware, this represents the first attempt to apply BFO to the realm of IoT devices and Cyber-Physical Systems. Finally, we explore how BFO could be applied to the modelling of human factors, focusing specifically on the notion of capabilities. We also outline an ontological approach to the representation of trustrelated concepts, drawing on research that is spread across a number of disciplines, including sociology and analytic philosophy. The present report makes a number of substantive contributions to the field of security modelling and IoT ontologies. These contributions include the following: • A mapping of the W3C Semantic Sensor Network (SSN) ontology to a mid-level extension of BFO. • An ontological approach to the modelling of IoT data flows. • A novel account of value that is inspired by recent work in cognitive neuroscience and generative AI. • A BFO-conformant approach to the representation of trust and trustworthiness • A BFO-conformant approach to the representation of digital twins. • An innovative proposal regarding the use of biophysical principles to inform the design of future Cyber-Physical Systems.","tags":["SofIots"],"title":"SOfIoTS: Ontological Framework, Demonstration Outcomes, and Recommendations for Further Work (D3/D4)","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Sunder Ali Khowaja","Ik Hyun Lee","Kapal Dev","Muhammad Aslam Jarwar","Nawab Muhammad Faseeh Qureshi"],"categories":null,"content":"\n","date":1656720000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1656720000,"objectID":"fc0e84c21b254e5baa42d828e426a186","permalink":"https://example.com/publication/tnse2022/","publishdate":"2022-07-02T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/tnse2022/","section":"publication","summary":"Published in IEEE Transactions on Network Science and Engineering","tags":[],"title":"Get your Foes Fooled: Proximal Gradient Split Learning for Defense against Model Inversion Attacks on IoMT data","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Muhammad Aslam Jawar","Jamie Tooth","Jeremy Watson CBE"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1655942400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1655942400,"objectID":"602b16a3e44aaeb28faf92821774b4ee","permalink":"https://example.com/publication/sofiot_report_3/","publishdate":"2022-06-23T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/sofiot_report_3/","section":"publication","summary":"The Internet of Things (IoT) devices are the ears and eyes for Cyber Physical Systems (CPS) and smart applications. The adoption of IoT devices is rapidly increasing both through advanced smart consumers as well as industrial applications such as smart homes, smart buildings, smart mobility, supply chain, and industrial control systems. The IoT devices are used to sense the status of physical environments such as temperature and humidity in a home or supermarket chiller, or vibration in machinery, with sensed data then transported to edge devices and cloud servers for advanced analytics and decisions. Whilst the adoption of IoT devices and digital technologies brings numerous benefits to the CPS in industrial and consumer application domains, they also introduce new cybersecurity risks and challenges. Cybersecurity risk needs to be identified, assessed, and managed with respect to socio-technical aspects and security goals. Most cybersecurity risks increase as more IoT devices are adopted and interact with human operators, users, and environments. This report investigates the use of ontological methods for security modeling of IoT devices, to support the security of IoT devices themselves and their data streams from multiple heterogenous sensors and advanced secure digital twins. Security Ontologies are developed to represent and standardize cybersecurity knowledge through a common vocabulary and machine-interpretable formalism. This will enable cybersecurity experts and software agents to share and communicate IoT security knowledge between each other in the same language. Furthermore, the ontological approaches enable the contextualization and localization of cybersecurity issues through argumentation and machine learning. There are a range of security ontologies and frameworks providing concepts and properties for modeling the security of wireless sensor networks and their data, but none have directly focused on IoT devices. These security ontologies mainly provide very specific classes and properties for application-level modeling and do not follow standardized approaches that enable the reusability and extendibility of ontologies. Existing security ontologies have not focused on the Safety, Resiliency, and Availability concerns of IoT devices which are vital for internet/intranet connected Cyber-Physical Systems and Critical National Infrastructure. Most importantly, these existing security ontologies have not considered the limited computing power of IoT devices.\nIn this report, we analyze the ontological as well as non-ontological resources for discovering the security concepts, properties, and ontological approaches which support safe and secure IoT applications. First, we investigated how the concepts and properties from security ontologies can be used with the W3C Semantic Sensor Network (SSN) ontology for modeling the security of IoT devices. We also discovered that Asset, Vulnerability, Threat, Impact, and CounterMeasures were the common concepts used in most security ontologies. Second, we reviewed the NIST Vulnerability Description Ontology (VDO) which aims to: (1) standardize descriptions of vulnerabilities in a common format, (2) Automate scoring of vulnerabilities without focusing on any specific device or system, (3) Improve the level of detail in information provided to assist with defense whilst minimizing the increasing risk of cyber-attack and (4) Improve the sharing of information regarding vulnerabilities without any language hurdles. In terms of deficiencies, the VDO has not provided classes that focus on security goals and socio-technical security aspects. The third ontology we reviewed was W3C-Web of Things Security Ontology (WoT-SO), which is still in its initial phase and has not been standardized by the W3C. The main objective of WoT-SO is to represent machine interpretable security mechanisms for Things over the web such as services, data, and devices that use web technologies. The other four reviewed security ontologies include reference ontology for IoT Security (IoT-Sec), STAC ontology, Cybersecurity Vulnerability Ontology (CVO), and Industrial Control Security and Threat Modeling Ontology (ICSaTMO). All four of these security ontologies have used similar concepts and properties except ICSaTMO, which focused on safety, the risk of vulnerabilities, and potential cyber-threats to the industrial controls connected to digital technologies and devices. The challenges posed by IoT devices' security to connected CPS and digital twins raise new research opportunities. Based on the analysis of existing studies, we can report that there is a research gap in many aspects of cybersecurity for IoT devices. For instance, there is a need for ontological frameworks and methods which focus on security data interoperability and integration for secure CPS and secure digital twins, resiliency modeling for IoT devices, and secure APIs for interfacing with the digital as well as physical part of digital twins. Ontological methods can be explored to grant a socio-technical lens of IoT device security, deducing complex relationships between IoT devices and environments to choose the most appropriate countermeasure against cyber-attacks, mapping IoT device security controls to achieve desired security goals, and argumentation for context-based access and control of IoT devices.

On the glorious, majestic Throne sat the one and only, King Daniel the III, he was a good King as he could be, hosting events, banquets and much more. The kingdom itself was protective indeed, elite archers, mighty commanders, and brave knights with strong Armor. Until the fearsome drowned, sharp-teeth monsters charged towards the hopeless kingdom and destroyed all what was left. But one day, a fearless hero arrived and fought them off, I’m going to tell you a story you never expected. It was a happy, bright day. The market people were filled with charming smiles on their faces. It was a cacophony of people talking, gossiping, and laughing. The stalls were filled with apples, valuables and jewellery. “May I have these 3 apples?” asked a Boy. “Sure, it will be 6 coins!” replied the Shopkeeper “Alright, here you go.” said the boy He handed 6 shiny, golden coins to the Shopkeeper with respect, he was quite sensible and kind to the people around him. He took the 3 apples and sprinted to the wooden, stables, there were 3 beautiful stallions, so he decided to give one each to the Horses. After feeding them, he heard a man shouting as he was screaming. “Help! A Robber has stolen my precious gold!” shouted the man.\n","date":1643241600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1643241600,"objectID":"83843e358cfe0c713e4e9c0f31dc8b01","permalink":"https://example.com/blogs/hufs_1/","publishdate":"2022-01-27T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/blogs/hufs_1/","section":"blogs","summary":"Far away, from the lands of the mighty titans..","tags":[null,null],"title":"THE TALE OF THE DROWNED BEASTS - CHAPTER 1","type":"blogs"},{"authors":["Muhammad Aslam Jarwar","Adriane Chapman","Mark Elliot","Fatemeh Raji"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1638489600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1638489600,"objectID":"30c4b8af76a8487af7a92a337c2338c3","permalink":"https://example.com/publication/provanon_data/","publishdate":"2021-12-03T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/provanon_data/","section":"publication","summary":"Published in The 2021 joint UNECE/Eurostat Expert Meeting on Statistical Data Confidentiality","tags":["provanon"],"title":"Modelling data environments within PROV to assist anonymisation decision-making","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Muhammad Aslam Jarwar","Sunder Ali Khowaja","Kapal Dev","Mainak Adhikari","Saqib Hakak"],"categories":null,"content":"\n","date":1630540800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1630540800,"objectID":"01b9005e271e95209b586c4d9fbe5739","permalink":"https://example.com/publication/iee_iot_neat/","publishdate":"2021-09-02T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/iee_iot_neat/","section":"publication","summary":"Published in IEEE Internet of Things Journal","tags":[],"title":"NEAT: A Resilient Deep Representational Learning for Fault Detection using Acoustic Signals in IIoT Environment","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Muhammad Aslam Jarwar","Adriane Chapman","Mark Elliot","Fatemeh Raji"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1626825600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1626825600,"objectID":"0eeee6dd226ef9cd5cc37018ada71b98","permalink":"https://example.com/publication/provanon_arxiv/","publishdate":"2021-07-21T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/provanon_arxiv/","section":"publication","summary":"The Anonymisation Decision-making Framework (ADF) operationalizes the risk management of data exchange between organizations, referred to as \"data environments\". The second edition of ADF has increased its emphasis on modeling data flows, highlighting a potential new use of provenance information to support anonymisation decision-making. In this paper, we provide a use case that showcases this functionality more. Based on this use case, we identify how provenance information could be utilized within the ADF framework, and identify a currently un-met requirement which is the modeling of data environments. We show how data environments can be implemented within the W3C PROV in four different ways. We analyze the costs and benefits of each approach, and consider another use case as a partial check for completeness. We then summarize our findings and suggest ways forward.","tags":["provanon"],"title":"Provenance, Anonymisation and Data Environments: a Unifying Construction","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"\rThe SOfIoTS project aims to understand and develop cybersecurity attributes for existing Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) network ontologies to include machine learning at the Edge.

Data provenance is a record of creation and modification of data. It has many uses, including scientific reproducibility, debugging, and establishing trust in data. The insight driving this project is that the core elements of the data environment (agents with access to the data; supplementary data which might be integrated with the data; infrastructure in which the data is stored and processed; and governance of the data) have the potential to be mapped with W3C PROV [3]. W3C PROV is an interoperability standard for provenance that defines the actors, entities, and activities which together created the dataset, and the relationships between them. Using PROV, we can map where data came from, and how they were processed. The objectives of this project are to:\rUndertake an analysis of modelling data environments, expressing terms as described in [1] using PROV concepts, including any domain-specific extensions to PROV that may be required to support this new usage.\rIdentify how to use provenance not only as a record of the development of the data, but also to help create contractual agreement in how data will be utilised after sharing, and how it can be used to support/comply with GDPR and other data privacy legislation.\rDetermine what improvements can be made to the operational power of the ADF by using the PROV representation.\rCollaborations:\rPlease refer project main website Task and Responsibilities:\rReasoning over provenance for analysing data situation in the data environments.\rTo Investigate models and approaches to automating and testing of compliance of data ethics, GDPR, etc.\rTo investigate Retrospective, Prospective, Prescriptive, Proscriptive provenance for expressing data situation and reasoning for anonymisation decisions.\r","date":1598918400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1598918400,"objectID":"bfa788788a278b789d8bdd8f1452d8fd","permalink":"https://example.com/project/provanon/","publishdate":"2020-09-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/provanon/","section":"project","summary":"In this project we are investigating that how the use of  provenance formalisms will enable us to capture the necessary features of the complex dynamic data situations to allow more principled analysis of risk, the requirements of anonymisation and related topics such as Cyber Security, privacy and data utility.","tags":["PROVANON"],"title":"Provenance and Anonymisation (PROVANON)","type":"project"},{"authors":["",""],"categories":["research",null],"content":"Overview In a highly competitive inter departmental research proposal competition at the University of Manchester I won a small amount of research grant .

Due to its easiness and effective medium, people share and exchange information, carry out discussions on various events, and express their opinions. For effective policy making and understanding the response of a community on different events, we need to monitor and analyze social media. In social media, some users are more influential, for example, a famous politician may have more influence than a common person. These influential users belong to specific communities. The main objective of this project was to analyze the sentiments of a specific community on various events.
