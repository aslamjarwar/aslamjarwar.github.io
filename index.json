On the glorious, majestic Throne sat the one and only, King Daniel the III, he was a good King as he could be, hosting events, banquets and much more. The kingdom itself was protective indeed, elite archers, mighty commanders, and brave knights with strong Armor. Until the fearsome drowned, sharp-teeth monsters charged towards the hopeless kingdom and destroyed all what was left. But one day, a fearless hero arrived and fought them off, I’m going to tell you a story you never expected.  It was a happy, bright day. The market people were filled with charming smiles on their faces. It was a cacophony of people talking, gossiping, and laughing. The stalls were filled with apples, valuables and jewellery.  “May I have these 3 apples?” asked a Boy.  “Sure, it will be 6 coins!” replied the Shopkeeper  “Alright, here you go.” said the boy  He handed 6 shiny, golden coins to the Shopkeeper with respect, he was quite sensible and kind to the people around him. He took the 3 apples and sprinted to the wooden, stables, there were 3 beautiful stallions, so he decided to give one each to the Horses. After feeding them, he heard a man shouting as he was screaming. “Help! A Robber has stolen my precious gold!” shouted the man.\n\r","date":1643241600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1643241600,"objectID":"83843e358cfe0c713e4e9c0f31dc8b01","permalink":"/blogs/hufs_1/","publishdate":"2022-01-27T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/blogs/hufs_1/","section":"blogs","summary":"Far away, from the lands of the mighty titans..","tags":["",""],"title":"THE TALE OF THE DROWNED BEASTS - CHAPTER 1","type":"blogs"},{"authors":["Muhammad Aslam Jarwar","Adriane Chapman","Mark Elliot","Fatemeh Raji"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1638489600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1638489600,"objectID":"30c4b8af76a8487af7a92a337c2338c3","permalink":"/publication/provanon_data/","publishdate":"2021-12-03T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/provanon_data/","section":"publication","summary":"Published in The 2021 joint UNECE/Eurostat Expert Meeting on Statistical Data Confidentiality","tags":[],"title":"Modelling data environments within PROV to assist anonymisation decision-making","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Muhammad Aslam Jarwar","Sunder Ali Khowaja","Kapal Dev","Mainak Adhikari","Saqib Hakak"],"categories":null,"content":"\n","date":1630540800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1630540800,"objectID":"01b9005e271e95209b586c4d9fbe5739","permalink":"/publication/iee_iot_neat/","publishdate":"2021-09-02T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/iee_iot_neat/","section":"publication","summary":"Published in IEEE Internet of Things Journal","tags":[],"title":"NEAT: A Resilient Deep Representational Learning for Fault Detection using Acoustic Signals in IIoT Environment","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Muhammad Aslam Jarwar","Adriane Chapman","Mark Elliot","Fatemeh Raji"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1626825600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1626825600,"objectID":"0eeee6dd226ef9cd5cc37018ada71b98","permalink":"/publication/provanon_arxiv/","publishdate":"2021-07-21T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/provanon_arxiv/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":[],"title":"Provenance, Anonymisation and Data Environments: a Unifying Construction","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"\rdiv.a {\rtext-align: center;\r}\rdiv.b {\rtext-align: left;\r}\rdiv.c {\rtext-align: right;\r}\rdiv.d {\rtext-align: justify;\r}\r\rThe SOfIoTS project aims to understand and develop cybersecurity attributes for existing Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) network ontologies to include machine learning at the Edge.

Data provenance is a record of creation and modification of data. It has many uses, including scientific reproducibility, debugging, and establishing trust in data. The insight driving this project is that the core elements of the data environment (agents with access to the data; supplementary data which might be integrated with the data; infrastructure in which the data is stored and processed; and governance of the data) have the potential to be mapped with W3C PROV [3]. W3C PROV is an interoperability standard for provenance that defines the actors, entities, and activities which together created the dataset, and the relationships between them. Using PROV, we can map where data came from, and how they were processed. The objectives of this project are to:\r\rUndertake an analysis of modelling data environments, expressing terms as described in [1] using PROV concepts, including any domain-specific extensions to PROV that may be required to support this new usage.\rIdentify how to use provenance not only as a record of the development of the data, but also to help create contractual agreement in how data will be utilised after sharing, and how it can be used to support/comply with GDPR and other data privacy legislation.\rDetermine what improvements can be made to the operational power of the ADF by using the PROV representation.\r\rCollaborations:\rPlease refer project main website \r\rTask and Responsibilities:\r\rReasoning over provenance for analysing data situation in the data environments.\rTo Investigate models and approaches to automating and testing of compliance of data ethics, GDPR, etc.\rTo investigate Retrospective, Prospective, Prescriptive, Proscriptive provenance for expressing data situation and reasoning for anonymisation decisions.\r\r\r","date":1598918400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1598918400,"objectID":"bfa788788a278b789d8bdd8f1452d8fd","permalink":"/project/provanon/","publishdate":"2020-09-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/provanon/","section":"project","summary":"In this project we are investigating that how the use of  provenance formalisms will enable us to capture the necessary features of the complex dynamic data situations to allow more principled analysis of risk, the requirements of anonymisation and related topics such as Cyber Security, privacy and data utility.","tags":["PROVANON"],"title":"Provenance and Anonymisation (PROVANON)","type":"project"},{"authors":["",""],"categories":["",""],"content":"Overview  The Wowchemy website builder for Hugo, along with its starter templates, is designed for professional creators, educators, and teams/organizations - although it can be used to create any kind of site The template can be modified and customised to suit your needs.

Due to its easiness and effective medium, people share and exchange information, carry out discussions on various events, and express their opinions. For effective policy making and understanding the response of a community on different events, we need to monitor and analyze social media. In social media, some users are more influential, for example, a famous politician may have more influence than a common person. These influential users belong to specific communities. The main objective of this project was to analyze the sentiments of a specific community on various events. For detecting the event-based sentiments of a community we developed a novel framework.\r\rTasks:\r\rTo detect communities from twitter data sets using snowball sampling.\rTo identify events based on demographic locations and topics using recurrent neural network.\rTo detect event wise sentiments of communities using deep using recurrent neural network.\r\r\r","date":1420070400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1420070400,"objectID":"33872b84a553d84216dc022a5a93406c","permalink":"/project/communiments/","publishdate":"2015-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/communiments/","section":"project","summary":"The main objective of this project was to detect the sentiments of a specific community on various events.","tags":["communiments"],"title":"Detecting Event related Sentiments of a Community (CommuniMents)","type":"project"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"f26b5133c34eec1aa0a09390a36c2ade","permalink":"/admin/config.yml","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/admin/config.yml","section":"","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"","type":"wowchemycms"}]
