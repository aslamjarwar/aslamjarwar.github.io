Freshwater ecosystems—especially rivers—are essential to both human and ecological well-being. They provide clean drinking water, support a wide range of recreational activities, and sustain local economies reliant on clean water, such as fisheries. However, pollution poses a serious threat to these vital resources and the ecosystems they support.
&lt;br&gt;
This project tackles the challenge of river pollution through a collaborative effort with AquaSensor, a company specializing in advanced water quality monitoring technologies. The initiative is supported through internal funding and will run from 1 June 2024 to 31 July 2024.

The SOfIoTS project aims to understand and develop cybersecurity attributes for existing Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) network ontologies to include machine learning at the Edge. The project’s planned outcomes will result in publications on which further academic endeavor can be built, whilst contributing to the understanding and methodologies of data security and assurance in Building Management Systems (BMS) in sensitive public buildings.
&lt;br/&gt;The SOfIoTS project, in partnership with National Physical Laboratory (NPL), Cube Controls, RITICS, 4D-SIG and PETRAS SRF1 project, ELLIoTT, will undertake a comprehensive review of IoT Network Ontologies to identify gaps in security provision, particularly with respect to industrial, buildings and utilities control applications. This will draw upon experience and review data from RITICS and ELLIoTT.
&lt;br/&gt;
The project will look at the Semantic Sensor Network (SSN) Ontology (w3.org), to include local machine learning functionality, and to provide methods for mapping abstract representations to specific ‘in context’ configurations of application. The project will also create a dialogue to promote delivery and impact through RITICS and the 4D-SIG to the UK Digital Twins programme and to the Centre for Digital Built Britain.

      <title>Provenance and Anonymisation (PROVANON)</title>
      <link>https://example.com/project/provanon/</link>

PROVANON, a Turing Institute pilot project is examining how the use of provenance formalisms can be used to capture the necessary features of dynamic data situations to allow more principled analysis of risk, the requirements of anonymisation and related topics such as data ethics and utility. Data provenance is a record of creation and modification of data. It has many uses, including scientific reproducibility, debugging, and establishing trust in data. The insight driving this project is that the core elements of the data environment (agents with access to the data; supplementary data which might be integrated with the data; infrastructure in which the data is stored and processed; and governance of the data) have the potential to be mapped with W3C PROV [3]. W3C PROV is an interoperability standard for provenance that defines the actors, entities, and activities which together created the dataset, and the relationships between them. Using PROV, we can map where data came from, and how they were processed. The objectives of this project are to:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Undertake an analysis of modelling data environments, expressing terms as described in [1] using PROV concepts, including any domain-specific extensions to PROV that may be required to support this new usage.
&lt;li&gt;Identify how to use provenance not only as a record of the development of the data, but also to help create contractual agreement in how data will be utilised after sharing, and how it can be used to support/comply with GDPR and other data privacy legislation.
&lt;li&gt;Determine what improvements can be made to the operational power of the ADF by using the PROV representation.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;b/&gt;Task and Responsibilities:&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Reasoning over provenance for analysing data situation in the data environments.
&lt;li&gt;To Investigate models and approaches to automating and testing of compliance of data ethics, GDPR, etc.
&lt;li&gt;To investigate Retrospective, Prospective, Prescriptive, Proscriptive provenance for expressing data situation and reasoning for anonymisation decisions.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;div class=&#34;d&#34;&gt;
Social media has revolutionized human communication and styles of interaction. Due to its easiness and effective medium, people share and exchange information, carry out discussions on various events, and express their opinions. For effective policy making and understanding the response of a community on different events, we need to monitor and analyze social media. In social media, some users are more influential, for example, a famous politician may have more influence than a common person. These influential users belong to specific communities. The main objective of this project was to analyze the sentiments of a specific community on various events. For detecting the event-based sentiments of a community we developed a novel framework.
&lt;/br&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Tasks:&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;/ui&gt;To detect communities from twitter data sets using snowball sampling.
&lt;/ui&gt;To identify events based on demographic locations and topics using recurrent neural network.
&lt;/ui&gt;To detect event wise sentiments of communities using deep using recurrent neural network.
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
