ABSTRACT="As we continue to develop the Internet of Things (IoT), it's important that
we consider how to ensure security and privacy for these resources
constrained device networks and their data without sacrificing performance.
This research paper offers an innovative solution at the intersection of
IoT middleware and Blockchain technology, specifically the Hyperledger
fabric. Through the use of a distributed decentralized ledger, we can
overcome many of the limitations of current IoT networks. This paper
outlines a robust layered IoT model that can be applied to any use case,
providing security and privacy at the edge of IoT devices. We conducted an
implementation setup to test the model and validate the security measures
embedded through Blockchain design. Additionally, we improved IoT devices
interoperability through the use of semantic ontologies. Overall, this
research contributes to the ongoing effort to create a secure and efficient
IoT ecosystem."
