ABSTRACT="In this era of Information and Communication Technology (ICT) and the
Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT), semantic interoperability plays an
important role in the interworking among different standards. One such
standard is oneM2M, which supports semantic interoperability between
non-semantic oneM2M resource model and semantic data, but it is only
limited to Resource Description Framework (RDF) triple data. Where Next
Generation Service Interfaces - Linked Data (NGSI-LD) provides an
information model and protocol for enhancing the capabilities to represent
more complex structures of Linked Data, limited research has been conducted
regarding such framework or protocol to support the interpretation and
translation among these two different standards. This paper proposes a
mapping protocol, to interpret and translate the non-semantic oneM2M
resource data to NGSI-LD interfaces."
